"""An Input that completes as you type: a dim tail to preview, tab to take, tab again to walk.

A query bar and a form field want the same thing from a text box: while you type, show what
the leading candidate would make of it; on tab, take it; on tab again, walk to the next one.
They differ only in *where* the candidates come from and how an accepted one is spliced back
— a query bar replaces the token under the caret, a form field replaces the whole value — so
that difference is the one thing injected, as a ``suggester``.

The offer is never written into the value until it is taken. Typing is therefore never
fought: the only thing that changes underneath is the dim tail and whatever the owning
screen does with :class:`CompletingInput.Offered`.
