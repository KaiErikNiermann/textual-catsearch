"""The text field every catsearch widget types into.

Textual's ``Input`` binds ``ctrl+backspace`` and ``alt+backspace`` to ``delete_right_word`` —
backwards from what those chords mean in a shell, a browser or an editor, and from Textual's
own ``ctrl+w``. At the end of a line, which is where a query is usually being edited, deleting
rightward has nothing to delete, so the chord reads as dead rather than as wrong.
